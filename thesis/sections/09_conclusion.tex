\chapter{Conclusion}

\section{Summary}
This thesis develops and evaluates a unified protocol for comparing explanation faithfulness across
saliency and concept methods in chest X-ray AI.

\section{Future Work}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Extend to external validation datasets.
  \item Add clinician reader studies for human factors and safety utility.
  \item Add a dedicated text-rationale track (constrained vs unconstrained) as a separate follow-on project.
\end{itemize}

\section{Current Draft Status (Pre-Data)}
This draft is prepared before final credentialed access to the full MIMIC-CXR image corpus.
Therefore, final thesis claims are not based on completed full-cohort runs yet. The current
repository state supports:
\begin{itemize}
  \item full pipeline execution once data is available (E0 $\rightarrow$ E1 $\rightarrow$ E2/E3 $\rightarrow$ E7),
  \item randomization-sanity aggregation for repeated-run analysis (E8),
  \item synthetic end-to-end smoke testing for integration validation without protected data.
\end{itemize}
Accordingly, this chapter currently defines the final reporting structure and required tables;
quantitative values will be populated after full-data execution under the locked protocol.

\section{Diagnostic Performance}
Report baseline and method-level predictive performance.

\section{Faithfulness Benchmark Results}
Present saliency-versus-concept faithfulness comparisons under unified stress tests, with
component-level metrics (sanity, perturbation, robustness) as primary evidence and NFI as a
secondary summary.

\section{Concept Intervention Findings}
Report concept intervention sensitivity and concept-faithfulness behavior under the shared protocol.

\section{Ablation Results}
Summarize effects of concept supervision, perturbation choices, and backbone sensitivity.
